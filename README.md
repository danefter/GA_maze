# GA_maze
Processing AI Assignment using adaptive Genetic Algorithm to solve a maze.
Partially based off of repository https://github.com/greerviau/Obstacle-Navigation/tree/master/ObstacleNavigation to start out with, I recommend looking there to build your own GA or just test it out if you want to learn!

# Install Processing
Select Mac, Windows, or Linux version, depending on what machine you have. Installation on each machine is straightforward:

On Windows, you'll have a .zip file. Double-click it, and drag the folder inside to a location on your hard disk. It could be Program Files or simply the desktop, but the important thing is for the processing folder to be pulled out of that .zip file. Then double-click processing.exe to start.
The Mac OS X version is also a .zip file. Double-click it and drag the Processing icon to the Applications folder. If you're using someone else's machine and can't modify the Applications folder, just drag the application to the desktop. Then double-click the Processing icon to start.
The Linux version is a .tar.gz file, which should be familiar to most Linux users. Download the file to your home directory, then open a terminal window, and type:
tar xvfz processing-xxxx.tgz
(Replace xxxx with the rest of the file's name, which is the version number.) This will create a folder named processing-3.0 or something similar. 

Then change to that directory:
cd processing-xxxx

and run it:
./processing
